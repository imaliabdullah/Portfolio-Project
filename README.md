# Portfolio-Project

Hello there! I'm Ali Abdullah, a dedicated Bio Medical Engineering student with a passion for Data Science.

With a unique blend of expertise in both Bio Medical Engineering and Data Science, I bring a fresh perspective to the world of technical solutions. As someone who understands the intricacies of biomedical systems, I'm well-equipped to harness the power of Data Science techniques and Machine Learning to solve complex challenges in the healthcare and life sciences domains.

My journey as a Bio Medical Engineering student has granted me in-depth knowledge of the human body, medical devices, and healthcare processes. I've seamlessly integrated this domain-specific insight with my proficiency in data science, allowing me to craft innovative solutions that bridge the gap between biology and technology.

From predictive modeling to image analysis, I specialize in a wide range of machine learning techniques. Whether it's extracting meaningful insights from medical images, analyzing patient data to uncover patterns, or developing algorithms for disease prediction, I'm here to provide tailored solutions that contribute to the advancement of healthcare.

But what truly sets me apart is my commitment to excellence. I approach each project with meticulous attention to detail and a genuine eagerness to make a positive impact. My goal isn't just to deliver results; it's to deliver results that matter.

Here is my Project List: 

## Web Scraping
For web scraping, leverage a combination of powerful libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Selenium, and Scrapy to extract data from diverse websites.

## Iris Classification 
This project is dedicated to scrutinizing the machine learning algorithms employed in the iris dataset. Its primary goal is to determine the most effective algorithm and assess its accuracy. Through a combination of exploratory data analysis and the application of various machine learning models, I aim to gain valuable insights into our dataset's characteristics and the performance of different algorithms.

## Heart Disease
In this project, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset better. Then, I built and tested various models to evaluate their accuracy and performance. Finally, I deployed the best-performing model into a web application.

## Titanic Case Study
This case study showcases the development of a binary model to predict the probability of survival in the loss of Titanic. I demonstrate the overall modeling process, including preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model fitting, adjustment, and interpretation as well as other relevant techniques such as imputation for missing data. 

## An ML Approch for analyzing Customer Churn
In this analysis, we dealing with data provided by a Teleco Company in California Q2 2022 on Customer Churn. The purpose of this study is to analyze the provided data, try to find some meaningful interpretations and focus on finding a relevant ML model for predictive purpose.


Your feedback and insights are highly appreciated as we embark on this journey of optimizing our machine-learning models.
